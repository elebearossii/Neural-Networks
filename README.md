# Project Title: StyleGAN-NADA Implementation

## Introduction

Welcome to the repository for our university project, an implementation inspired by the paper "StyleGAN-NADA: CLIP-Guided Domain Adaptation of Image Generators." This project explores the concepts presented in the paper within the scope of our academic coursework.

## Abstract

This project aims to replicate and experiment with the ideas proposed in the StyleGAN-NADA paper. The primary focus is on CLIP-guided domain adaptation of image generators, allowing for the synthesis of images aligned with specific textual descriptions.

## Features

- **CLIP-Guided Adaptation:** Implementation of CLIP-guided adaptation to align image generation with textual prompts.
- **Domain-Specific Image Synthesis:** Generation of images tailored to specific domains described through textual prompts.
- **Evaluation Metrics:** Metrics and evaluation scripts to assess the performance of the adapted StyleGAN-NADA model.
